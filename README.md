# Getting Started with Renode

Introduction to Renode, a software development framework for embedded systems.

## About Renode

Renode is a set of tools for embedded systems development that lets us simulate physical hardware systems. Initial development of an embedded system can be started on a general purpose computer without having access to the actual embedded hardware.

## Download

Renode can be downloaded for various platforms from the download section at [renode.io](https://renode.io/#downloads).

### Windows Installation

On a Windows machine you will download an installer file and the installation is started by just double clicking this file.

The installation process is more or less self-explanatory. I personally choose the option "Add to PATH" and left other options untouched.

Using the default options Renode ended up being placed at `C:\Program Files\Renode`.
